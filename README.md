# ai4pharma

üåê Overview

The ai4pharma project was initiated as part of the CABS Data Science Summer Intern Program, with the mission to foster innovation, skill development, and meaningful contribution to real-world biomedical challenges. Interns from diverse backgrounds are encouraged to collaborate on use-case driven solutions spanning the full pipeline of drug discovery and development.

This repository hosts curated, modular, and open-ended projects that integrate cutting-edge AI/ML tools (including OpenAI, LangChain, HuggingFace, and biomedical APIs) to tackle unmet needs in translational science, target identification, trial optimization, and beyond.
